# NYC-taxi-data-mining
This project discovers taxi travel patterns in New York City, USA, and builds machine learning models to predict whether gasoline taxis can switch to electric vehicles.

The New York City taxi trip data are available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml.

A paper has been published on top journals. Hu, Liang, Jing Dong, Zhenhong Lin, and Jie Yang.
